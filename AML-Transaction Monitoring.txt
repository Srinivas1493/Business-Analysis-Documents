AML is set of reguations that are implemented to curb money laundering activities and to counter terrorist financing activities.

In AML, the source or destination of fund plays a crucial role.

==============
AML Involves three stages:
Placement
Layering 
Integration

When we investigate, we look into which stages these transaction falls.
==============
In investigation also there are various levels like 
L1,
The Transaction is analysed from a broad view, if there is any doubt in transaction the RI(Request for Information) is asked.
L2,
L3
===============


Retail Banking:

Once onboarded, KYC is there...based on their profile the transactions are run on certain software which will generate an alert

Alert:

Anamolous or unusal Transaction which needs investigation

Alerts are created based on certain criteria:

*Typology
*Thershold detection scenario

For Eg:

Scenario 1:

High Risk Jurisdiction:
Any wire that involves high risk jurisdiction
A is sending a remitance/wire to B 

A resides in a low risk region such as US
B resided in a high risk area such as UAE
When there is an outward/Inward remittance from B's accounts, the transactions are monitored
Now the alert is generated due to High risk jurisdiction Transaction.
Now, the investigator goes and checks the transaction.
Note:
Every bank has its own High Risk Jurisdiction classification 

The Permenant address details of both the account's holders matches, along with their surnames.
Also, the source of fund seems legitimate.
Hence, this transaction is marked as not unusual/anamalous transaction.

Scenario 2:

Multiple Originator with Same beneficiaries:

Scenario 3:
A Customer makes the bank deposit more than the threshold value:

Eg:
Cash deposit of 1000 Euro/ $10000 is deposited in the account.

The Threshold setting also differs from country to country.
In India it is INR 50000

In this case the mode of payment is also considered:

-Cash
-Cheque
-Inter account transfer/ With in the Bank

Paypal in Europe


Scenario 4:

Potential Structuring:

Eg:

I have got $10000 amount

Diving of the amount into 25000, 35k, 20 k, 30 k and deposit in regular intervals.

It may not be in a week or 10 days, it can even be in a quarter.

The transaction inn the current month is compared agains the transaction in the previous quarter, if the transaction seems to be an
outlier, then an alert is generated.

Scenario 5:

A Customer has not used any cheque transaction in the past 12 months, all of a sudden he seems to use cheque/Instrument.

System can detect and generate and alert


Correspondent Bank also play an important role in AML.
